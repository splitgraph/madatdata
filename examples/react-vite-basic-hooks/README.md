# Vite: Basic Hooks Example (with Splitgraph)

This example was bootstrapped from the Vite `react-ts` template by following the
[official getting started guide from Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), i.e. by
running:

```bash
yarn create vite react-vite-basic-hooks --template react-ts
```

The default Vite settings should be sufficient for bundling packages from
Madatdata.

## What this example does

Run the example with

```ts
yarn dev
```

This is a basic one page example of the `useSql` hook with Splitgraph.

It displays the raw JSON results of sending a query via HTTP to the following
Splitgraph repository (see [`./src/App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx)):
